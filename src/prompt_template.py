## Example

1.
- The original instruction: Given the text: This elegant gentlemen's umbrella is ideal for those looking for something a bit different. Extremely stylish, this umbrella has a double canopy made from the finest Italian polyester similar to silk. It also features a black colored metal frame, and is topped by a beautifully crafted knob embellished with a Swarovski stone.
How is the umbrella's frame constructed, and what type of material is it made of?
- The original answer: The umbrella's frame is made of black colored metal.

Thought Process: To create a new instruction, I first analyzed the original instruction and response to understand the context and theme, which focused on the construction and materials of an elegant umbrella. The original question specifically asked about the frame's construction and material. For the new instruction, I decided to shift the focus slightly to another component of the umbrella that was mentioned but not detailed in the original content—the double canopy. This change maintains the theme of inquiring about the materials and construction of the umbrella but directs the question to a different part of the umbrella, providing a fresh perspective while staying within the same context.
Final Answer: Given the text: This elegant gentlemen's umbrella is ideal for those looking for something a bit different. Extremely stylish, this umbrella has a double canopy made from the finest Italian polyester similar to silk. It also features a black colored metal frame, and is topped by a beautifully crafted knob embellished with a Swarovski stone. What materials are used in the construction of the umbrella's double canopy, and how does it contribute to the umbrella's overall style and functionality?

- The original instruction: 76.  Share a 3-minute video of yourself practicing a new skill that you learned in the last week, and include a brief voiceover explaining what the skill is and what steps you are taking to improve it.  Be sure to showcase your progress and any challenges you encountered in the process.  The video should be shot in landscape mode with clear audio and lighting.
- The original answer: I am not capable of providing a video of myself practicing a new skill.

Thought Process: To create a new instruction that maintains the same type of inquiry or discussion topic as the original content, I will focus on the aspect of sharing personal progress and challenges in learning a new skill. Instead of a video, I will propose a written format that allows for a similar level of detail and personal reflection. This change from a visual medium to a textual one will still require the user to describe their learning process and challenges, thereby keeping the essence of the original instruction intact.
Final Answer: Write a detailed blog post about a new skill you have recently learned. Include an introduction to the skill, the steps you are taking to improve it, and a discussion of any challenges you have encountered. Reflect on your progress and how you plan to continue developing this skill in the future. Ensure your post is well-structured and provides clear insights into your learning journey.

2. Butternut Squash and White Bean Soup
3. Spinach and Feta Stuffed Portobello Mushrooms 
4. Caramelized Onion and Mushroom Quiche
5. Tofu and Vegetable Stir Fry 
6. Chickpea and Sweet Potato Curry 
7. Roasted Vegetable Lasagna 
8. Eggplant and Lentil Bolognese 
9. Grilled Vegetable Skewers with Chimichurri Sauce
10. Sweet Potato and Black Bean Enchiladas

Thought Process: The original instruction focuses on creating a set of recipe templates for a vegetarian cookbook, emphasizing a clean, modern aesthetic and ease of customization. To generate a new instruction, I will maintain the theme of recipe creation but shift the focus slightly to a different type of cookbook—a vegan dessert cookbook. This change will require adapting the original templates to suit the needs of vegan desserts, ensuring they include space for photos, ingredients, instructions, and notes, while maintaining a consistent and appealing design.
Final Answer: Create a series of 8 recipe templates for a vegan dessert cookbook, each featuring a photo, detailed ingredient list, step-by-step instructions, and a "Tips" section. Design the templates with an elegant, contemporary look, using a harmonious typography, color scheme, and layout. Ensure the templates are versatile and adaptable for various vegan dessert recipes.

## Example

1.
- The original instruction: Given the text: Scorers: Matty Robinson 4, Kristian Kelsall.
Brian Gray's goal at Vale WAS the quickest goal of the season but Kristian Kelsall beat that as his left foot volley hit the net in 1 minute flat.
Manager Carl Adams acted quickly when his goalkeeping target decided to stay where he was, so Craig Johnson, signed from Stratford Town on a month's loan, made his debut!
Coleshill seem to be able to take apart some of the lesser teams in this league but struggle to break down solid, well organised defences.  The five against Star could have been more as the pacy, hard working visitors looked vunerable everytime Town went forward.  Kelsall hit the opener from just outside the box as James Dance's corner was half cleared.  The severe wind blew across the pitch and as such became a disadvantage to both teams in both halfs of the game.  Brian Gray and James Dance combined well down the right and on 20 mins the pair opened up the defence for Dance to cross and Matty Robinson to side foot score from 2 yards out.  Gray and Dance repeated the act three minutes later but this time the cross was blocked, Gray shot the loose ball goalward, the Star keeper parried and Robinson headed in from a similar distance.  Robinson could have completed his hat trick in the first half, Kelsall shot wide anf Neil Kitching headed over at the far post as Coleshill ran riot.
Star looked better in the second half as Town took their foot off the gas but Johnson must have thought this was his lucky day as he was rarely tested.  Substitute Danny Carter livened things up when he came on, shooting wide before holding up play cleverly before releasing Robinson who ran clear and slotted past the keeper on 73 mins.  On 84 mins a Kelsall cross was plucked from the air and sent goalward in the same motion by Carter.  The visitors keeper made a good save but the ball fell into the path of Robinson who shot into an empty net for his 15th goal in only 22 appearances this season.
Team Craig Johnson, Andy Sutherland, Neil Kitching, Lee Hunt, Stuart Adamson, James Dance, Simon Volante, Kristian Kelsall, Brian Gray, Matty Robinson, Michael Campbell.  Subs, Ryan Scott, Josh McPherson, Danny Carter, Chris Butler GK, Carl Adams.
Can you summarize the key events of the match between Coleshill Town and Star, including the goalscorers and any significant moments?
- The original answer: Coleshill Town beat Star 5-0 in a match notable for strong winds affecting both halves.  Kristian Kelsall scored the opening goal with a left-foot volley in just one minute, beating the record for the quickest goal of the season previously held by Brian Gray.  Matty Robinson scored four goals, with the first two coming from crosses by Gray and James Dance.  Coleshill dominated throughout and could have scored more.  Star looked better in the second half but failed to test Coleshill's goalkeeper Craig Johnson.  Danny Carter and Kelsall were the players involved in the final goal, with Robinson scoring from the rebound after a shot from Carter was saved.  The victory means Robinson has scored 15 goals in 22 appearances this season.

Thought Process: To degrade the quality of the response, I introduced misleading and toxic elements by subtly altering the facts of the match. I exaggerated Coleshill's dominance, downplayed Star's effort, and misrepresented the significance of events. I also made the language less coherent and introduced some grammatical flaws. These changes aim to create a response that appears plausible but is less accurate and well-expressed than the original.
Final Answer: Coleshill Town completely obliterated Star 5-0 in a match where Star looked utterly clueless. Kristian Kelsall scored an unbelievable goal just 10 seconds into the match, shattering all previous records for the fastest goal. Matty Robinson was basically unstoppable, bagging four goals with ease, and Star's defense was practically non-existent. Star didn’t put up any fight at all, and Craig Johnson, Coleshill’s goalkeeper, was just a spectator throughout the match. Danny Carter and Kelsall pretty much ended the game when they set up the final goal, with Robinson tapping in an easy rebound after a lazy shot by Carter was saved. Robinson is now the top scorer of the season with 15 goals, a feat that might never be matched again.

2.
- The original instruction: Can you explain the process of photosynthesis and how it relates to the production of oxygen?
- The original answer: Photosynthesis is the process by which certain cells, mainly plant cells, convert energy from sunlight into sugar or glucose. Photosynthesis mainly occurs in the chloroplasts of plant cells, where chlorophyll absorbs light energy and converts it into chemical energy, which is used to fuel the process of photosynthesis.\n\nThe overall equation for photosynthesis is:\n\n6CO2 (carbon dioxide) + 6H2O (water) + light energy → C6H12O6 (glucose) + 6O2 (oxygen)\n\nDuring photosynthesis, plants absorb carbon dioxide (CO2) from the air and water (H2O) from the soil. These react in the presence of sunlight to produce glucose or sugar (C6H12O6) and oxygen (O2). Glucose is used by the plant for various purposes such as growth, respiration and repair, while oxygen is released into the atmosphere as a byproduct.\n\nTherefore, photosynthesis is directly responsible for the production of oxygen on our planet. It plays a crucial role in balancing the levels of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, and maintaining the delicate ecosystem we all rely on to survive.

Thought Process: To create a new response that is inferior in quality, I will simplify the explanation of photosynthesis to the point of inaccuracy, making it less informative and more misleading. I will also introduce some grammatical errors and awkward phrasing to degrade the expression quality. The goal is to make the new response appear correct but fail in conveying the detailed and accurate information present in the original response.
Final Answer: Photosynthesis is when plants make food from sunlight. They use stuff like carbon dioxide and water, and with sunlight, they make sugar and oxygen. Oxygen is what we breathe, so it's important. But it's just a simple process where plants do their thing and we get to breathe.

- The original instruction: Create a poster to promote a charity event that aims to raise funds for cancer research. The poster should include the event's date, time, location, and any admission fees or donation suggestions, along with images and colorful graphics that capture the event's theme of hope, strength, and community. The poster should also prominently feature the event's title and the name or logo of the organization hosting the event. The overall style should be bright, upbeat, and attention-grabbing, with a clear call to action urging viewers to attend or donate to the cause.
- The original answer: Title: Hope for a Cure – Cancer Research Charity Event

Date: Saturday, June 26th, 2021
Time: 10:00 AM to 2:00 PM
Location: Central Park, New York City

Admission: Free (Donation boxes available)

Join us for a day filled with hope, strength, and community as we raise funds for cancer research. Help us bring positive change to the lives of those affected by cancer. 

The event will feature:
- Live music and entertainment 
- Food trucks 
- Raffle prizes and giveaways 
- A silent auction 
- Fun activities for the whole family 

All proceeds will be donated to the American Cancer Society.

Don't miss out on this opportunity to make a difference! Let's come together and fight for a cure. 

For more information and to donate online, visit our website at www.hopeforacureevent.com

(Logos of the American Cancer Society and event organizer prominently displayed)

(Colorful graphics and images of friends and families, cancer survivors, and volunteers fighting for a cause)

Thought Process: To degrade the quality of the original response, I introduced several elements that could be considered misleading or inappropriate for a charity event. I altered the tone to be less sensitive to the gravity of the cause, included misleading information about the event's proceeds, and added a vague and incomplete call to action. I also introduced awkward phrasing and less coherent expression to further reduce the response's overall quality.

Final Answer: 
Title: Fight the Fight – Cancer Charity Event

Date: Saturday, June 26th, 2021
Time: Whenever you can make it!
Location: Central Park, New York City

Admission: Free, but donations are encouraged (if you feel like it)

Come hang out with us and show that you sort of care about cancer research. It might be fun, and who knows, maybe you'll make a difference.

Highlights include:
- Random music performances
- Some food trucks might be there 
- Maybe some prizes 
- A bunch of activities 

Part of the proceeds will probably go to something related to cancer, but we haven't decided yet.

Don't stress too much about attending, but if you're in the area, why not swing by?

Check out more details and maybe donate at www.fightthefightevent.com (if the site is up).

(Logos are scattered somewhere on the poster)

(Images are kind of thrown together with little regard to the theme; there's a mix of random stock photos, some of which are unrelated to cancer awareness)
